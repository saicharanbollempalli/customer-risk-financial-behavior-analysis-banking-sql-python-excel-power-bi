## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Excel/CSV (Data Cleaning & Setup)**
   - Validated and pre-processed raw data into structured tables

2. **SQL (Analysis & KPIs)**
   - Wrote multiple queries to extract insights:
     - Avg income by loyalty group
     - Risk weighting by age groups

     - High-risk customer behavior

3. **Python (EDA & Validation)**
   - Used `pandas` and `matplotlib` for statistical summaries and trend validation

4. **Power BI (Dashboard Design)**
